# Ephemories
Ephemories is a MERN Fullstack project where users can create "ephemos" or small bits of text on a webpage and have it disappear after a week.

## Server
The backend server is an Express Node.js app that connects to a MongoDB Atlas cluster to handle data storage and retrieval. It is designed with Domain-Driven Design in mind. It follows the following design patterns:
- MVC
- Repository
- Dependency Injection
- Decorators

### Backend Features
- Logging Middleware
- Error handling (need to flesh out)
- Pagination
- DB Migrations
- Unit/Integration Testing (coming soon)

## Backend TS Rest
This is a backend implementation with the ts-rest library and zod

## Backend Custom
This is a basic Node.js app with my own "interpretation" of backend framework and tools, basically going to try to model Nestjs with dependency injection, MVC, decorators, schema validation, etc

## Backend Rust
A Rust implementation of a backend API, oooooo

## Client
The client will be a React app that is connected to the server. Coming soon.
